  Candidates for this exam should have foundational knowledge of core data concepts and how they are implemented using Microsoft Azure data services.
  
  This exam is intended for candidates beginning to work with data in the cloud.
  
  Candidates should be familiar with the concepts of relational and non-relational data, and different types of data workloads such as transactional or analytical.
  
  Azure Data Fundamentals can be used to prepare for other Azure role-based certifications like Azure Database Administrator Associate or Azure Data Engineer Associate, but itâ€™s not a prerequisite for any of them.
subTitle: 'Prove that you can describe the following: core data concepts; how to work with relational data on Azure; how to work with non-relational data on Azure; and an analytics workload on Azure.'
