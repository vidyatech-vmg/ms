Do you configure, deploy, and manage Office 365 workloads for Microsoft Teams that focus on efficient and effective collaboration and communication in an enterprise environment? Do you plan, deploy, and manage Teams chat, apps, channels, meetings, audio conferencing, live events, and calling? Are you responsible for upgrading from Skype for Business to Teams? Are you proficient at managing Teams settings by using PowerShell? Do you have a fundamental understanding of integration points with apps and services, including but not limited to SharePoint, OneDrive for Business, Exchange, Azure AD, and Office 365 Groups? If so, I have a great opportunity for you to showcase your skills and be recognized for them . . . take and pass this beta exam!

Taking a beta exam is your chance to have a voice in the questions we include on the exam when it goes live. The rescore process starts on the day that exams go live, and final scores are released approximately 10 days later. For updates on when the rescore is complete, follow me on Twitter ([@libertymunson](https://twitter.com/libertymunson)). For questions about the timing of beta exam scoring and live exam release, see the blog posts [The Path from Beta Exam to Live Exam](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/community-blog-post.aspx?BlogId=8&Id=374675) and [More Tips About Beta Exams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/community-blog-post.aspx?BlogId=8&Id=374723).

Remember, the number of spots is limited, so when they're gone, they're gone. You should also be aware that there are some countries where the beta code will not work (including Turkey, Pakistan, India, and China). You will not be able to take the beta exam in those countries.

Also keep in mind that these exams are in beta, which means that you will not be scored immediately. You will receive your final score and passing status after your exam is live.
