[Microsoft is announcing the release of three job-role based Azure data and AI certifications](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/community-blog-post.aspx?BlogId=8&Id=375200), focused on validating your skills in cutting-edge technologies that are changing how organizations think about and leverage data in their digital transformation journey. Now more than ever, leveraging advanced analytics and machine learning to drive insights for data-driven decisions is key to an organization’s competitive advantage. With data becoming so accessible to everyone, organizations need to ensure that that their data is hygienic and unified, and that users have access to up-to-the-minute insights that allow them to make informed decisions that drive their businesses forward. These emergent trends underscore the critical importance of strong and proven skills in the data and AI space—competitive skills that are increasingly difficult for employers to find (IDC, 2017*).

On January 31, 2019, three new Azure data and AI certifications are launching (in beta):

***[Microsoft Certified: Azure AI Engineer Associate](https://www.microsoft.com/learning/azure-ai-engineer.aspx)** (one exam, [AI-100](https://www.microsoft.com/learning/exam-AI-100.aspx))*

Combining data assets, building out a design across structural, non-structural and streaming data sets allows organizations to build a data solution that provides them with the business insights to be competitive in nowadays market.
