# Microsoft Azure IoT Developers: I’ve got something for you!

Posted 9 Jan 2020 by **Liberty Munson (Microsoft)**

Are you a developer implementing, coding or maintaining cloud or edge components of IoT solutions? Is part of your job to manage devices life cycle – set up, configuration, and maintenance – using cloud services? Do you design IoT solutions including device topology, connectivity, debugging, and security? Do you implement solutions to manage, monitor, and transform data related to IoT? If these job responsibilities sound familiar, I have a great opportunity for you to showcase your skills and be recognized for them: **Take the beta exam [AZ-220: Microsoft Azure IoT Developer](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/certifications/exams/az-220?WT.mc_id=az220_AZ220blog_cert_examaz220-blog-wwl).**

By passing the beta exam, you will be among the first to earn the new **[Microsoft Certified: Azure IoT Developer Specialty](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/certifications/azure-iot-developer-specialty?WT.mc_id=az220_AZ220blog_cert_aziotdeveloper-blog-wwl)** certification!

## It gets better

The first 300 people who **take the beta exam on or before February 23, 2020** can receive an **80% discount on market price**.

To receive the exam discount, use the code **AZ220LACONIA** at registration when prompted for payment (***this is **not** a private access code***). The 300 seats are offered on a first-come, first-served basis. You must take the exam on or before February 23, 2020 to receive this discount ([Why beta exams are no longer free](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/community-blog-post.aspx?BlogId=8&Id=374922)).

Take the beta exam as soon as possible so we can use your comments, feedback and exam data to ensure the quality of the questions.

## Preparing for Beta exams

- Review the [AZ-220 prep guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/certifications/exams/az-220?WT.mc_id=az220_AZ220blog_cert_examaz220-blog-wwl) and practice the skills listed
- Microsoft Official Courseware to help you prepare for this beta exam is available. [Find classroom and online training from Microsoft Learning Partners](https://www.microsoft.com/learning/partners.aspx)
- Free online learning to support this certification will be available on [Microsoft Learn](https://www.microsoft.com/learn) by the end of this month. Follow [@MicrosoftLearn](https://twitter.com/microsoftlearn) for content updates

Taking a beta exam is your chance to have a voice in the questions we include on the exam when it goes live. The rescore process starts on the day that exams go live, and final scores are released approximately 10 days later. For updates on when the rescore is complete, follow me on Twitter ([@libertymunson](https://twitter.com/LibertyMunson)). For questions about the timing of beta exam scoring and live exam release, see the blog posts [The Path from Beta Exam to Live Exam](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/community-blog-post.aspx?BlogId=8&Id=374675) and [More Tips About Beta Exams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/community-blog-post.aspx?BlogId=8&Id=374723).

Remember, the number of spots is limited, so when they're gone, they're gone. You should also be aware that there are some countries where the beta code will not work (including Turkey, Pakistan, India, and China). You will not be able to take the beta exam in those countries.

Also keep in mind that these exams are in beta, which means that you will not be scored immediately. You will receive your final score and passing status after your exam is live.
