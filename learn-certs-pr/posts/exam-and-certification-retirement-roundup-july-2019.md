# Exam and Certification Retirement Roundup, July 2019

Posted 25 Jul 2019 by **Liberty Munson (Microsoft)**

**UPDATE as of 8/19/19:** 98-369: Cloud Fundamentals will retire on 9/30/19. It will be replaced by AZ-900: Azure Fundamentals. If you are registered to take this exam after 9/30/19, you will be given the opportunity to reschedule the exam prior to that date or to take AZ-900 in its place.

To ensure that the Microsoft Certified Professional Program stays current, Microsoft Learning continually monitors trends and then revises exams and certification requirements to keep pace with changes in technology and business needs. Our goal is to give you several months’ notice of upcoming exam retirements. We review our certification program plan, the psychometric performance, and our upcoming exam list every quarter. We then make decisions about what to retire and when, so we can ensure that you have the most up-to-date certifications and that these certifications reflect the latest in Microsoft technologies and associated job roles.

Many of the upcoming exam retirements reflect the program’s evolution to embrace [role-based certifications](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/community-blog-post.aspx?BlogId=8&Id=375159). Here's the current plan, which is subject to change . . . as things often are. If a date changes, it will push out. If anything, these dates are the worst-case scenarios.

Exams retire at 11:59 PM Central Standard Time on the dates below. [Browse all exams](https://www.microsoft.com/learning/exam-list.aspx).

Exam retirements lead to certification retirements. These certifications are retiring because there won't be any exams (or enough exams) in market to earn these certifications as of these dates. Note that when we retire certifications that you have earned, those certifications stay on your transcript and can be shared as usual. A retired certification stays in the active section of your transcript until Microsoft determines that the technology is no longer relevant, and then it gets moved to the inactive section.
