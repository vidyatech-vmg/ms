If you’re reading this, you are most likely considering expanding your skills with a Microsoft Dynamics 365 certification. Not at all surprising given that [businesses love Dynamics 365](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/en-us/customer-stories/). To help you do just that, we’re launching a series of role-based certifications designed specially to showcase your Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations Functional consultant skills. (We also have [certifications for Customer Engagement Specialists](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/community-blog-post.aspx?BlogId=8&Id=375180).)

All Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations certification paths begin with the same prerequisite exam: [Exam MB-300](https://www.microsoft.com/learning/exam-MB-300.aspx): Dynamics 365 Unified Operations Core (available March 31, 2019). This exam validates your ability to analyze business requirements and translate those requirements into fully realized business processes and solutions that implement industry best practices and implement and configure applications to meet business requirements. If you have a fundamental understanding of accounting principles and financial operations of businesses, customer service, field service, manufacturing, retail, and supply chain management concepts, this is the certification track for you. After you pass the core exam, you can specialize in one of these areas:

***Microsoft Certified: Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Financials Functional Consultant Associate***  
If you specialize in the financials feature set of Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations, you should take [Exam MB-310](https://www.microsoft.com/learning/exam-MB-310.aspx): Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Financials (available March 31, 2019) and MB-300.

***Microsoft Certified: Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Manufacturing Functional Consultant Associate***
