# Help Us Create Exams and Learning Content! Join Our SME Database Today!

Microsoft needs your help creating our learning and exam content. To facilitate this, we’ve created the SME Profile database where you can provide us with information about your skills and abilities. With the SME Profile database program, we can connect with SMEs who are passionate about Microsoft's training and credentialing efforts. Through the program, participants can take part in exam and learning development activities such as courseware authoring, exam item writing, acting as technical reviewers, and participating in research. Perhaps the best benefit is getting special invites to participate in beta exams. SMEs in the database receive a special beta exam discount code that, while limited to a set number of seats, is only provided to that group. Being a member has its privileges.

Here are the basic steps:

- The SME Profile database is hosted as an engagement under the **Microsoft Collaborate developer program.** Joining requires a Microsoft account and registration to the developer site, so you'll need to make sure you have an account.
- Join the Worldwide Learning SME Profile engagement on Microsoft Collaborate and complete your profile survey.

That's it! OK, there are a few more steps required, but this is the basic gist. For step-by-step instructions (and lots of screen captures), download the attached PDF called **Joining the SME Profile engagement on Microsoft Collaborate.**

Many people on Microsoft's Worldwide Learning team use the database to search for SMEs who can assist with content development—from creating courses to reviewing them to writing exam content to reviewing items and setting the passing score (really!)—and participating in research designed to define the direction we head as a learning organization. As an active participant in the SME Profile database program, you can have a say in what we teach, how we evaluate skills, and the future of our program. Not too shabby. But, I suspect that the reason you’ll join is because those in our SME database get a unique code to participate in beta exams (one that is not posted here), increasing the likelihood of getting a seat in that beta exam that you really want to take. Join today!
