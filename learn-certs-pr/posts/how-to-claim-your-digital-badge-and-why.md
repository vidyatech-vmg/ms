# How to Claim Your Digital Badge—and Why (updated)

**Note: The Acclaim platform is now provided by Credly.**

If you’ve passed a Microsoft certified exam or earned a technical certification, your digital badge awaits. Look for an email from Microsoft (mscert@microsoft.com) or from Credly's Acclaim platform, our badging service. The email contains a link to create an account on the Acclaim platform to accept your badge. It’s no problem if you can’t find the emails—just create an account on the [Acclaim platform site](http://www.youracclaim.com/) with the same email address that Microsoft has on file for you.

Your Microsoft badge empowers you to:

- Easily share your certifications and exams with your professional network on LinkedIn, other social channels, and email. Your Microsoft badge contains metadata uniquely linked to you, so when someone views your badge on LinkedIn, for example, they’ll be able to learn more about your skills and to verify its authenticity—ensuring that only you can take credit for your skills.
- Search for new job opportunities (and salary projections!) associated with your certification and apply in just a few clicks. Accept a badge in your Acclaim account to activate the job data, which is visible only to you as the badge earner. [Learn more about job data in the Acclaim platform](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/community-blog-post.aspx?BlogId=8&Id=375167).

So, what are you waiting for?

[See all Microsoft badges on the Acclaim platform](https://www.youracclaim.com/org/microsoft-certification). For more details and FAQs, [see our digital badging](https://www.microsoft.com/learning/badges.aspx) page which lists the active exams and certifications that are eligible for badges. If you earned a badge for an exam or certification that was chosen to be part of the digital badge program but was later placed on the [retired list](https://www.microsoft.com/learning/retired-certification-exams.aspx), you can still redeem the badge via the Acclaim platform and share it as usual to other platforms or by email.

Having trouble accepting your badge? Reach out to [Credly‘s support team](http://support.youracclaim.com/) for additional assistance.
