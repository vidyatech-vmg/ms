[Technology is revolutionizing the finance industry](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/bdm/2018/10/19/6-trends-that-will-redefine-finance-in-2019/), helping companies become more responsive, efficient, and secure. With this digital transformation, the role of finance and operations in business is also changing. By providing data analysis and strategic insight, finance and operations now play a more critical role in driving business success than they once did. According to CFOs around the world, the most important skills an organization needs to develop in order to deliver finance and operations effectively in the near future are analysis, prediction, and decision support skills. But those skills are in short supply, creating a [finance talent gap](https://deloitte.wsj.com/cfo/2019/03/19/bridging-the-finance-talent-gap/). Though they’re hiring more people with these new finance skills and [CFOs want people in their companies to upskill](https://www.robertwalters.co.uk/content/dam/robert-walters/country/united-kingdom/files/whitepapers/Bridging-The-Skills-Gap-In-Finance-Functions.pdf) in this area, there aren’t enough qualified people at the moment to fill the need.

This is true for the many organizations that use Microsoft Dynamics 365, too. There’s a growing demand for people with certified skills in Finance and Operations in Dynamics 365. More and more companies today use Dynamics 365 to help them face the ever-changing risks and challenges of current markets. By adopting this set of business applications, they empower people across the organization to drive success. But to unlock the potential of Dynamics 365, people need to be trained to use these tools, and the number of people trained to use Dynamics 365 has not kept pace with companies’ adoption of this technology. Right now, for example, there’s a [gap between Dynamics 365 tools and Dynamics 365 skills in Finance and Operations](https://www.nz365guy.com/dynamics-skill-gap-how-to-solve-it/). That means, building your skills and getting certified in Finance and Operations in Dynamics 365 can help you and your company succeed.
