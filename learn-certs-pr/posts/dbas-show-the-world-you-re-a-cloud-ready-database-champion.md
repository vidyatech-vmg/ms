# DBAs: Show the world you’re a cloud-ready database champion

Posted 09 Apr 2020 by **Liberty Munson (Microsoft)**

I’m excited to let you know that the [**DP-300: Administering Relational Databases on Microsoft Azure**](/learn/certifications/exams/dp-300?wt.mc_id=mim_msl_smc_datacertw2_prm_WWLblog_202049) beta exam is now available. This exam is required to earn the [**Azure Database Administrator Associate**](/learn/certifications/azure-database-administrator-associate?wt.mc_id=mim_msl_smc_datacertw2_prm_WWLblog_202049) certification.

There’s no time like the present for you, as a database administrator (DBA), to demonstrate how you add business value through your support of data state modernization efforts—whether you use on-premises, cloud, or hybrid scenarios. With this new Microsoft Certification, you can prove that your database administration experience and skills span from on-premises to the cloud.

## Is this the right certification for you?

Azure database administrators implement and manage the operation of cloud-native and hybrid data platform solutions built on Azure data services and SQL Server. These professionals are responsible for the management, availability, and security of databases, plus performance monitoring and optimization of modern relational database solutions. To perform day-to-day operations, the Azure DBA uses a variety of methods and tools, including applying their knowledge of T-SQL for administrative management. Is this how you spend your days? If so, this certification is for you.

## Ready to prove your Azure Database Administrator skills?

## About the beta exam process

Microsoft, together with our partner ecosystem, is adapting to the current environment to ensure that you can continue to learn and get certified on Microsoft technologies while staying safe (learn more by [reading this update on Microsoft training and certification](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/community-blog-post.aspx?BlogId=8&Id=375289)). As an alternative to taking your beta exam at a testing center, [online proctoring](/learn/certifications/online-exams) is available, allowing you to take your exam in the comfort of your own home (or office if that’s an option). Stay up to date with current [testing availability information from Pearson Vue](https://home.pearsonvue.com/coronavirus-update).

Further, to offer more flexibility in your scheduling options, we are extending the beta period.

**Keep in mind that beta exams aren’t scored immediately.** The rescore process starts on the day that exams go live, and final scores are released approximately 10 days later. For updates on when the rescore is complete, follow me on Twitter ([@libertymunson](https://twitter.com/LibertyMunson)). For questions about the timing of beta exam scoring and live exam release, check out [The path from beta exam to live exam](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/community-blog-post.aspx?BlogId=8&Id=374675) and [More tips about beta exams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/community-blog-post.aspx?BlogId=8&Id=374723).

Remember, the number of spots is limited to the first 300 candidates taking the DP-300 (beta) exam on or before May 31, 2020. Please note that _the beta exam is not available in Turkey, Pakistan, India, or China_.
