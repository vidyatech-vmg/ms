# Learning Partners Offer Vital Virtual Dynamics 365 Training

Posted 14 April 2020 by **Nancy Tandy, Business Strategy Manager, Worldwide Learning**

With more than 91 percent of Fortune 500 companies today using Dynamics 365 and Microsoft Power Platform, getting certified in Dynamics 365 can help increase your opportunities. Microsoft provides a carefully designed set of training options to help you reach that goal, from free digital online classes that you work through at your own pace to virtual instructor-led training (VILT) classes offered by [Microsoft Learning Partners](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/partners.aspx?WT.mc_id=Blog10__Partners-Blog-wwl).  

The different online training types—self-paced and virtual instructor-led—work together to help ensure your success, so working with a Learning Partner is essential to achieving certification and your career goals. Fortunately, there are Learning Partners around the world, many offering Dynamics 365 training.
<br/>
<br/>

## ILT helps prepare you for the certification exams

According to the [2018 Pearson Vue Report](https://d.docs.live.net/5f9ea9146a2a51ca/MS%20Learn/Blog%20posts/Blog%20posts%209-12/84%25%20of%20respondents%20reported%20receiving%20instructor-led%20training) on the Value of IT Certification, 84 percent of respondents reported receiving instructor-led training. The main reason? ILT prepares you to pass the certification exams. The training offered by Microsoft Learning Partners is _designed_ to prepare you for the exams and it’s taught by _Microsoft-certified_ instructors, which makes it a solid investment of your time and money.  Microsoft Learning Partner [Directions Training](https://directionstraining.com/course-id/mb-240t01/) offers many ILT courses, for example, [MB-240 – Microsoft Dynamics 365 Field Service](https://directionstraining.com/all-courses/cloud/mb-240-dynamics-365-for-field-service-6/). [Dynamics Edge](https://www.dynamicsedge.com/dynamics-365-training?ref=navz7) does also, for example, [MB-230 – Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Service](https://www.dynamicsedge.com/crs/23000?ref=v27_21).

## ILT helps you achieve your career goals

ILT offers much more than exam-prep. It gives you real-world skills. The instructors who teach Learning Partner courses are industry experts who help you gain skills that transfer directly from the classroom to the workplace. ILT also gives you access to digital resources that you can access after the course, to help you solve problems or create new models.
<br/>
<br/>

## Choose the kind of ILT that works for you

ILT isn’t one-size-fits-all. Learning Partners offer a variety of ways to get your expert ILT training, so you can choose how you, or your team, want to learn. You can:

- Participate in a **virtual live classroom** with real-time, instructor-led _online_ training. Engage with instructors and peers without traveling and practice solving problems in scheduled exercises. [Fastlane](https://www.fastlaneus.com/microsoft-productivity) offers [Microsoft Dynamics 365 Fundamentals (MB-900)](https://www.fastlaneus.com/course/microsoft-mb-900#top), for example; [QuickStart Technologies](https://www.quickstart.com/find-training/technology/microsoft.html#q=Dynamics&idx=QSProduction_quickster_en_products&hFR%5Bcategories.level0%5D%5B0%5D=Find%20Training%20%2F%2F%2F%20Technology%20%2F%2F%2F%20Microsoft&nR%5Bvisibility_catalog%5D%5B%3D%5D%5B0%5D=1) offers [Dynamics 365 Power Platform Automation](https://www.quickstart.com/dynamics-power-platform-automation-mb-200t02-a.html); and [New Horizons](https://www.newhorizons.com/mspartner) offers [MB-230T01 Dynamics 365 for customer engagement for Customer Service](https://seattle.newhorizons.com/training-and-certifications/course-outline/id/1035991905/c/mb-230t01-dynamics-365-for-customer-engagement-for-customer-service). [ONLC training centers](https://www.onlc.com/dynamics-365-training-classes-certification.htm) also offer remote, live ILT courses you can [attend from home](https://www.onlc.com/rci-home-or-office.htm), like [MB-320: Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Manufacturing Course Outline](https://www.onlc.com/outline.asp?ccode=AMB320).
<br/><br/>
- Choose **on-demand learning** to take advantage of classroom-quality instruction while working at your own pace. [NetCom Learning](https://www.netcomlearning.com/products/1426/Microsoft-Dynamics-365-training.html) offers this 16-hour on-demand training: [EDX2001: Dynamics: Power Platform Applications - MB-200.1](https://www.netcomlearning.com/courses/200012/EDX2001-Dynamics-Power-Platform-Applications-MB200.1-training.html). And [System Source](https://www.syssrc.com/cgi-bin/PCIP.pl?cmd=Schedules&classattr=Microsoft) offers [Analyzing Data with Power BI](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/course.aspx?cid=od20778?WT.mc_id=Blog10__PowerBI-Blog-wwl).
<br/><br/>
- Opt for **blended learning**, which combines the expert direction of virtual instructor-led training with the flexibility of on-demand learning. Weekly live virtual sessions to interact, scheduled instruction, and challenge-based learning combine in this progressive learning method. Some courses include remoted one-on-one training as well. Many Learning Partners, like [Koenig Solutions](https://www.koenig-solutions.com/dynamics-365-operations-ax7-technical-training) and [Tech Data](https://academy.techdata.com/uk/search/index/#?country=UK&selectedVendor=&searchTerm=dynamics%20365&guaranteed=) Corporation, offer blended learning courses.
<br/><br/>
- Request **private group training**. Learning Partners work with you to provide a customized professional development session at the location of your choice—to help you save money and time while increasing team’s skills and efficiency. [Webucator](https://www.webucator.com/microsoft-training/microsoft-dynamics-training.cfm) offers this three-day class as a private training: [Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customization and Configuration](https://www.webucator.com/microsoft-training/course/moc-55242-microsoft-dynamics-365-customization-configuration.cfm).
<br/><br/>
- Go to a Microsoft **certification boot camp**, such as these offered by [Certification camps](https://www.certificationcamps.com/new-microsoft-role-based-certifications/???). Dynamics Edge offers a virtual five-day [Dynamics 365 Power Platform Developer Bootcamp](https://www.dynamicsedge.com/crs/20000?ref=newtile).
