# Mapping Microsoft 70-xxx Exams to New Role-based Certifications

Posted 09 Jul 2019 by **Liberty Munson (Microsoft)**

Over the last year, Microsoft has rolled out 23 new role-based certifications. To help orient you in the new program, below is a table showing how the 70-xxx exams align to our new certification program. Use this table if you:

- have passed an exam on the left side of the table and want to show that you are staying up to date in the related technology,
- were considering becoming certified with one of the exams on the left side of the table (why not prove your skills are up to date and cloud based?!?), or
- have experience in the technology covered by one of the exams on the left side of the table (again, I challenge you to prove your skills are up to date and cloud based by earning the role based certification on the right!)
