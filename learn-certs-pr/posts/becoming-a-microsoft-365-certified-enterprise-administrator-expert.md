# Becoming a Microsoft 365 Certified Enterprise Administrator Expert—The Final Steps

Posted 13 Dec 2018 by **Liberty Munson (Microsoft)**

And now for the rest of the story . . . (how many of you know that pop culture reference?*) on how you, too, can become a **Microsoft 365 Certified: Enterprise Administrator Expert.**

The [Microsoft 365 Certified: Enterprise Administrator Expert](https://www.microsoft.com/learning/m365-enterprise-administrator.aspx) certification validates your skills and experience in the modern workplaces and helps you to further streamline the way your users interact with technology. To earn this certification, you must earn one of our new associate-level [workload certifications](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/community-blog-post.aspx?BlogId=8&Id=375179) ([Modern Desktop Administrator](https://www.microsoft.com/learning/modern-desktop.aspx), [Teamwork Administrator](https://www.microsoft.com/learning/m365-teamwork-administrator.aspx), [Security Administrator](https://www.microsoft.com/learning/m365-security-administrator.aspx), or [Messaging Administrator](https://www.microsoft.com/learning/m365-messaging-administrator.aspx)), as well as pass Exam [MS-100: Microsoft 365 Identity and Services](https://www.microsoft.com/learning/exam-ms-100.aspx) AND Exam [MS-101: Microsoft 365 Mobility and Security](https://www.microsoft.com/learning/exam-ms-101.aspx).

***Do you have your [MCSE: Productivity](https://www.microsoft.com/learning/mcse-productivity-certification.aspx) certification?*** If so, this meets the workload requirement! You only need to pass **Exam MS-100: Microsoft 365 Identity and Services** AND **Exam MS-101: Microsoft 365 Mobility and Security** to earn your Microsoft 365 Certified: Enterprise Administrator Expert.

Exam MS-100 focuses on your ability to design and execute Microsoft 365 solutions. From the basics of setting up a tenant to multi-factor authentication to configuring remote access solutions for internal and external users. Exam MS-101 ensures that you have the skills you need to implement secure productivity solutions—in this age where data breaches seem to happen every day, this skill is something every organization desperately needs. By passing both of these exams, you will have demonstrated that you have proven yourself capable of evaluating, planning, migrating, deploying, and managing Microsoft 365 services in a secure manner.

As I mentioned in my recent [exam retirement blog](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/community-blog-post.aspx?BlogId=8&Id=375158), MS-100 and MS-101 replace 70-346 and 70-347, which retire on March 31, 2019. There is no transition exam for those who have taken 70-346 or 70-347 to the new Microsoft 365 Enterprise Administrator Expert certification because the new certification is now an expert certification and the previous MCSA: Office 365 was essentially at our new associate level. You would need to take both MS-100 and MS-101 to earn the Microsoft 365 Enterprise Administrator Expert certification as well as one of our workload certifications.

Choosing any of Microsoft’s certification paths helps you to stand out to both current and potential employers, proving that you have the IT skills that they need to remain agile and competitive. And we help you prove it, too: one click on our newly redesigned [badges](https://www.microsoft.com/learning/badges.aspx) allows colleagues and employers to confirm your specialization  and learn more about your qualifications. This helps you stand out to your peers and employer, and even [unlocks new employment opportunities](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/community-blog-post.aspx?BlogId=8&Id=375167) based on your proven skills and knowledge.
