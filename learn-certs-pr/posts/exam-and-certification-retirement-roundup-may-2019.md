# Exam and Certification Retirement Roundup, May 2019

Posted 13 May 2019 by **Liberty Munson (Microsoft)**

This is a republication of [a blog that originally appeared in December, 2018](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/community-blog-post.aspx?BlogId=8&Id=375189). We've updated the blog each month since then. This is a fresh copy of that blog, with already-retired exams removed from the list. Today we are not announcing new retirements.

To ensure that the Microsoft Certified Professional Program stays current, Microsoft Learning continually monitors trends and then revises exams and certification requirements to keep pace with changes in technology and business needs. Our goal is to give you several months’ notice of upcoming exam retirements. We review our certification program plan, the psychometric performance, and our upcoming exam list every quarter. We then make decisions about what to retire and when, so we can ensure that you have the most up-to-date certifications and that these certifications reflect the latest in Microsoft technologies and associated job roles.

Many of the upcoming exam retirements reflect the program’s evolution to embrace [role-based certifications](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/community-blog-post.aspx?BlogId=8&Id=375159). Because we haven't announced many of the upcoming role-based certifications, I can't be overly specific about the replacement exams. Many of the exams are retiring in the next few months, and I want to give you as much advance notice as possible. This is all the information I can share right now, so take it for what it's worth as you make your certification plans. I promise to share as much information as I can, as soon as I can. Trust me to look out for you!

Here's the current plan, which is subject to change . . . as things often are. If a date changes, it will push out. If anything, these dates are the worst-case scenarios. Exams retire at 11:59 PM Central Standard Time on the dates below. [Browse all exams](https://www.microsoft.com/learning/exam-list.aspx).

Exam retirements lead to certification retirements. These certifications are retiring because there won't be any exams (or enough exams) in market to earn these certifications as of these dates. Note that when we retire certifications that you have earned, those certifications stay on your transcript and can be shared as usual. A retired certification stays in the active section of your transcript until Microsoft determines that the technology is no longer relevant, and then it gets moved to the inactive section.

**Retiring June 30, 2019**

MCSA: Machine Learning  
MCSA: Data Engineering with Azure|  
MCSA: Dynamics 365 (only one of the two required exams is retiring in March, 2019, but the certification will no longer be attainable)
