If you’re reading this, you are most likely considering expanding your skills with a Microsoft Dynamics 365 certification. Not at all surprising given that [year after year, Gartner positions Dynamics 365 as a Leader and Visionary in their Magic Quadrant matrix](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/en-us/analyst-awards/). To meet that need, we’re launching a series of role-based certifications designed specially to showcase your Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement skills. (See also [Announcing New Certifications for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Unified Operations Functional Consultants](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/community-blog-post.aspx?BlogId=8&Id=375199).)

All Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement Functional Consultant certification paths begin with the same prerequisite exam: [MB-200: Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement Core](https://www.microsoft.com/learning/exam-MB-200.aspx) ([in beta now](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/community-blog-post.aspx?BlogId=8&Id=375203)). This exam validates your ability to use the infrastructure that Dynamics 365 sits on, as well as your ability to test, deploy, and integrate tools such as Power Platform. After you pass the core exam, you can specialize to earn any of these certifications.
