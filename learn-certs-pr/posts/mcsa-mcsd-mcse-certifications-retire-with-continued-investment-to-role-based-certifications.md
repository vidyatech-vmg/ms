# MCSA, MCSD, MCSE certifications retire; with continued investment to role-based certifications

Posted 28 Feb 2020 by **Alex Payne, GM, Global Technical Learning at Microsoft Worldwide Learning**

UPDATE: March 26, 2020. All remaining exams associated with Microsoft Certified Solutions Associate (MCSA), Microsoft Certified Solutions Developer (MCSD), Microsoft Certified Solutions Expert (MCSE) will retire on January 31, 2021

Microsoft’s focus on role-based training and certifications can help you develop necessary skills and experience to advance in an accelerated and increasingly competitive cloud-based world. Role-based training and certifications are kept current with new features and services that Microsoft is constantly adding to the cloud solution areas, minimizing skill gaps associated with the applicable job roles.

Since we announced our [focus on role-based training and certifications in September 2018](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/community-blog-post.aspx?BlogId=8&Id=375159), we’ve added a total of 34 certifications to our portfolio across Azure, Modern Workplace, and Business Applications. As we continue to expand on role-based learning offerings, all remaining exams associated with Microsoft Certified Solutions Associate (MCSA), Microsoft Certified Solutions Developer (MCSD), Microsoft Certified Solutions Expert (MCSE) will retire **on June 30, 2020**.

If you’re working towards a MCSA, MCSD, or MCSE certification, you’ll want to pass all required exams before they retire. The [list below](#exams-retiring-on-june-30-2020) shows existing exams that will retire. Note that training content may continue to be available in these areas even after the exams have retired.

If you have an existing MCSA, MCSD, and MCSE certification, it will remain on your Microsoft transcript, even after the exams retire. In fact, it will remain in the active section of your transcript for two years from June 30, 2020; at that time the certification will be moved to the “inactive” section of your transcript.

If you currently hold a MCSA, MCSD, or MCSE certification, why not update your profile with one of our new role-based certifications that may be relevant to you. Check out our recommended role-based certifications:

## FAQ

**Q. What happens to the MCSA, MCSD, MCSE certifications that I already have?**

**A:** Nothing happens to the MCSA, MCSD, and MCSE certification that you already have; they remain on your certification transcript even after the exams retire.
