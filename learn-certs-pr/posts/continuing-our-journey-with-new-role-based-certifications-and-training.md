# Catching up: continuing our journey with new role-based certifications and training

Posted 31 Jan 2019 by **Alex Payne (Director of Global Customer Learning, Microsoft)**

Last September at [Ignite](https://www.microsoft.com/ignite), [we announced an evolved approach to Microsoft’s professional training and certifications](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/community-blog-post.aspx?BlogId=8&Id=375161). Our approach shifted from technology-centric to job role-centric, focused on developing the skills you need to advance in an accelerated and increasingly competitive, cloud-based world. We’ve received great feedback that helped make our training and certifications as relevant as possible to your work. So, we want to catch you up on our progress, share what we’ve learned, and give you a look at our plans for 2019.

**New role-based certifications**  
Remaining relevant means staying ahead of the curve, and Microsoft is committed to helping you keep your skills sharp and stay competitive. To date, we’ve launched new training and exams covering [13 job roles](https://www.microsoft.com/learning/browse-new-certification.aspx) across Apps and Infrastructure, Modern Workplace, Data and AI, and Business Applications.

Here is the latest wave of certifications that have been released:

**Moving forward**

Over the next few months, we’ll be rolling out additional certifications in Azure security engineering and multiple Dynamics 365 roles. If you’ve been thinking of starting a certification but aren’t sure, consider that a 2018 [Deloitte survey](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/deloitte-private/articles/technology-trends-middle-market-companies-survey.html) highlighted reskilling as a major priority for employers. Research has found that certification improves overall team productivity, reduces costs, and creates jobs*. Moreover, certified talent is key to implementing the cloud-first strategies that keep your business competitive. Our redesigned certifications shift focus from individual technologies to skills and knowledge needed to perform in specific job roles, helping close the skills gap that prevents as many as 68% of organizations from deploying cloud solutions. By designing our content around the job you need to do (rather than the technologies available), we’ve simplified the process of attaining skills and knowledge that add value and help advance your career. Once you’re certified, [Microsoft badge](https://www.microsoft.com/learning/badges.aspx)s make it easy to broadcast your accomplishment and allow others to easily verify your skills. Whether you’re looking to advance in your current role or are planning your next move, Microsoft certifications help you unlock your potential.
