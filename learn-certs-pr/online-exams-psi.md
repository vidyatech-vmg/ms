# About online exams with PSI

## Introduction to online exams with PSI

PSI Services is a company Microsoft partners with to deliver exams. Fundamentals and role-based certification exams that are part of the [USD15 exam offer for job seekers and students](/learn/certifications/skillingoffer?WT.mc_id=gsi) must be taken online through PSI.

You’ll select language preference for the exam when you register. Please note that proctor support and the proctoring software are available in English only.

## Before you register for an online exam

1. Make sure your computer meets or exceeds the minimum system requirements (detailed below).
2. Complete the required [system test](https://syscheck.bridge.psiexams.com/) on the same computer and in the same location from where you will test.
3. Review the technical, system, environment, and testing protocol requirements below.
4. Confirm that your ID is compliant (read the identity verification requirements below) and that the name on your Microsoft Certification profile, used upon registering for the exam appointment, is up to date. To take the exam, your name used to enter the exam appointment must match the ID you will present.
5. Read the [Non-Disclosure Agreement](/learn/certifications/microsoft-exam-non-disclosure-agreement) (NDA). At the start of your exam, you must read and agree to the NDA and General Terms of Use for Microsoft Certification Exams; this section is NOT timed separately. Any time you spend reading this at the beginning of the exam comes from the overall time you have to complete the exam. While we have added time to account for this, we strongly recommend that you read it before your exam to ensure that you fully understand the requirements and can agree to them quickly. If you do not agree to the NDA, you will not be able to take the exam.
6. If you would like to request accommodations for your exam, please [submit an accommodations request](https://psi-cdexp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000150872) with PSI **before** you schedule your exam. PSI will respond within 48 business hours.

## <a name="run-a-system-check"></a> Run a system test

Run a system test on the same computer and in the same location from where you will test to verify if your computer, location, and internet connection are compatible with the PSI software and testing requirements.

[Run system test now.](https://syscheck.bridge.psiexams.com/)

## Technical tips

### Software and permissions

- Test on a personal computer rather than a work computer, if possible, because work computers have software installed that will prevent PSI Bridge software from launching.
- You may need to configure your internet security and antivirus software to make an exception for the PSI Secure Browser executable file.
- Some antivirus software can cause performance issues. Please disable antivirus scanning while taking your exam.
- You may need to ensure that your security software does not block the execution of JavaScript, Adobe Air applications, or Adobe Flash Player extensions.

### Network

- Online proctored exams can be disrupted by proxy servers, network packet inspection/filtering, or strict network security configurations.
- When taking an online proctored exam, use a hard-wired internet connection, if possible.
- Do not tether to a mobile hotspot; this is explicitly prohibited.

## Testing environment requirements

To maintain the integrity of online proctored exams, we enforce specific policies, practices, and procedures.

### Office or home setting

Your office or home setting must meet the following requirements:

- Office, conference room, or space at home must be walled, have a closed door, and be free from disruptions.
- No one else can be in or enter the room during your testing session.

### Communicating with the proctor

- **Chat window.** All communication with the proctor occurs via the chat window.
- **Language.** All communication with the proctor is conducted in English only.

### Identity verification

- You are required to present a current government-issued form of ID, such as one of the following:
  - Driver's license.
  - Passport.
  - Identification card (national/state/province identity card).
  - Alien registration card (green card, permanent resident, visa).
  - Government-issued local language ID (not in Roman characters)—accepted only if issued from the country in which the candidate is testing.
- A webcam photo will be taken of you and your photo ID as part of the check-in process.
- The name on the government issued ID you present to enter the exam must **exactly** match the name on your Microsoft Certification and PSI profiles.
- If you are in the process of updating or renewing your identification, please note that legal name change forms, including ID renewal forms, cannot be accepted for online exams.

### Exam area scan

- Prior to starting the exam, ensure that all additional monitors are unplugged and turned away from you, and any other computers are turned off and monitors are dark.
- The exam area should be clear of all materials, and the following are not allowed within view: books, notepads, Post-it notes, typed notes/papers, or writing instruments such as pens, markers, whiteboards, or pencils.
- With your webcam, phone, or laptop, you will be asked to scan slowly left to right to show surrounding walls and to scan up and down to show the floor and ceiling during check-in. If you are unable to complete an exam area scan, you are not permitted to proceed further or to take the exam. The proctor will review the area scan and will notify you if another room scan is required or if anything needs to be addressed prior to launching the exam.

### No personal belongings

- During the exam, you may not access hand-held computers or other electronic devices, pagers, watches, wallets, purses, hats (or other head coverings), bags, coats, books, notes, or any other materials not specifically approved.
- In the event of a support issue, technical support may try to contact you on your mobile phone at the number you provide during exam check-in. The proctor will let you know that technical support is trying to contact you via chat. Please ensure your mobile phone number includes the country code. It is acceptable to keep the cell phone nearby but not within arm's reach and upside down. Set your phone to vibrate.
- If you are wearing long sleeves, you may be asked to roll up your sleeves to show that there is no writing on your arms.
- If you are wearing a tie, you may be asked to lift the tie to show the proctor that nothing is hidden under the tie.
- If you have long hair that covers your ears, you may be asked to pull your hair back to show the proctor that there is nothing attached to your ear (such as a Bluetooth earpiece).

### No breaks or eating

- Breaks are not allowed during the exam for any reason. You understand and agree that, if you take a break, your exam score will be invalidated, and you will not be allowed to resume the exam later.
- Eating, smoking, and chewing gum are prohibited during the exam. You may have a glass of water in a clear container if you will need something to drink during the exam.

### No exam assistance

- No one can enter the room during your testing session. If this occurs, your exam will be terminated.
- You may not receive assistance or coaching from other individuals while taking the exam, and you may not allow other individuals to see the computer screen during the exam.
- You are not allowed to use books or other resources, scratch paper, erasable whiteboards or similar, or any writing instruments, such as a pen, marker, or pencil, during exam delivery.
- The proctor cannot answer questions related to exam content. If you have questions related to exam content, please contact Microsoft after you complete the exam.

### Recording during the exam

- When taking this exam, the proctor will continuously monitor you by video and audio. The entire session will be recorded. Monitoring will include your face (eye movements, head movements), voice, the physical room where you are seated, and the location during the exam. If you do not wish to be recorded (either by video or audio), please notify the proctor immediately. You will NOT be able to proceed with the exam.

## Non-Disclosure Agreement

- As with any other Microsoft Certification exam, you must read and agree to the terms stated in our [NDA](/learn/certifications/microsoft-exam-non-disclosure-agreement).
- You must also comply with the candidate conduct requirements. This includes but is not limited to the following: 
  - You may not copy or record questions or answers from the exam using any means.
  - You may not share or discuss the questions or answers seen in the exam with others.
- If you do not follow the [Candidate Rules Agreement](https://www.pearsonvue.com/rp/rp_candidate_rules_agreement.pdf) or are suspected of cheating or tampering with software from PSI or its subcontractor, or if someone other than you is detected in the room where you are seated during the exam, the proctor will immediately terminate the exam and report the infraction to Microsoft, along with audio and/or video evidence. Your exam may be invalidated, and Microsoft may take other action, such as decertifying you and/or banning you from the Microsoft Certification Program.

## Register for an online exam

## Launching the exam and the candidate check-in process

The launch and check-in process should take approximately 15 minutes.

- Before launching your exam, review the [PSI FAQs](https://home.psiexams.com/#/faq) for details on what to expect.
- Make sure you have your mobile phone outside of the immediate testing space. Technical support will let you know if they need to call you so you can have your phone ready.

To begin your testing session:

1. Sign in to your [Certification Dashboard](https://aka.ms/certdashboard) with the email associated with your Microsoft Certification profile. (If you cannot access your Microsoft Certification Dashboard at this step first, try again using an Incognito or InPrivate browser. If you still cannot access your Certification Dashboard open a case with [certification support](https://aka.ms/mcpforum) and a forum moderator will assist.)
2. In the Appointments section on the right, select “Start online exam”.
3. You will be brought to the PSI scheduling platform and will see a “Launch exam” button. Select “Launch exam” to initiate the secure browser download. Proceed through the self-check-in process and wait for a proctor to connect with you. (Note: You must select “Launch exam” to launch the exam; if you do not, the exam will not launch.)
4. You will be assigned to a proctor no later than the scheduled start time of your exam. If you are not connected to a proctor 30 minutes after your scheduled exam time, please [contact PSI support.](https://psi-cdexp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360001044112)
5. Identity verification and room scans are done by the proctor upon completion of the self-check-in. If no issues or concerns are identified during the review of these artifacts, you will be placed in the proctor queue. As soon as a proctor is available, you will be able to begin your exam. In the cases where the proctor has questions about the artifacts provided, the proctor will work with you to resolve them.
6. After this process is complete, the exam will begin. Your proctor will not contact you during the exam unless there is an issue.
7. If there is a technical issue during exam delivery, the proctor will first attempt to contact you via chat. If you run into an issue after the exam, [contact PSI support.](https://psi-cdexp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360001044112)
8. You will receive notification of your pass or fail status within a few minutes of completing your exam. In addition, you will receive an email from PSI that provides your exam score and feedback on your performance on the skill areas measured.

## Retrieve score report

The score report that PSI sends via email following the exam is the only score report that you’ll receive. You will not be able to access it through your dashboard, so do not lose it if you would like a detailed record of your performance.

## Remove proctor software

Once you’ve completed your exam with PSI, uninstall the executable files for the PSI Secure Browser by removing if from the Apps and Features in Windows 10 or by moving it to the trash on MacOS.<br/>
