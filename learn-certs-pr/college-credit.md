# College credit for certification exams

## Earn college credit

Students can get college credit for passing Microsoft exams and earning Microsoft certifications. College credits measure the number of applied hours that are recognized for successful completion of a particular course of study. Note that you’ll receive credit for receiving the certification, not for taking the course. 

Most schools in the United States are members of the American Council on Education (ACE), the only major higher education association to represent all types of U.S. accredited, degree-granting institutions. This includes two-year, four-year, public, and private colleges and universities. Two out of every three students in the U.S. are educated at an ACE school.

Students can also earn college credit through Excelsior College, an accredited online school. College credit through Excelsior College is managed through the National College Credit Recommendation Service (NCCRS).

## About ACE college credit

After successfully earning certain certifications, apply for credit hours through an ACE member school. [These schools are ACE member schools](https://www2.acenet.edu/crm/cup/) that review Microsoft certifications for college credits.

ACE recommendations for Microsoft exams last for three years. For more information about ACE and the exams they support, visit [ACE Credit System.](https://www2.acenet.edu/credit/?fuseaction=transcriptsPublic.getCourseSearchCriteria)


ACE has established credit recommendations for the following Microsoft Certification exams:

## How to send your Microsoft Certification transcript to your ACE college or university

You will order your transcript through Credly. To see how it works, watch [Credly’s 90-second video.](https://support.youracclaim.com/hc/en-us/articles/360042534771-Video-Credly-s-Transcript-Feature)
<br/><br/>
> [!VIDEO https://player.vimeo.com/video/409925283]

Most institutions will only consider a transcript official if it comes from the learning institution. You cannot send the transcript yourself.

Order your transcript to be sent to your college or university following these steps:

1. Log in to your account on [Credly.](https://youracclaim.com/) 
2. Access your account menu in the upper right of the screen and select “Send transcript”.
3. Provide the information in the form. This is an official document, so enter the information carefully. You will need the name and/or department and email address for the recipient of the transcript. This is normally available on the college’s website for information about where to send transfer transcripts.
4. When you’ve completed the form, click “Continue”.
5. Before you order, click on “View transcript” to download a free copy. Use this copy to check that all of your credentials are displayed correctly before you send an official version to your school. If a credential is missing on your transcript but it shows up on your profile, check to make sure that the credential is set to “Public” so that it can be included on your transcript.
6. Click “Send” and look for the pop up to let you know it’s been delivered.
