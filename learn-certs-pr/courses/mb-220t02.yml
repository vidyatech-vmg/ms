summary: |-
  Events, webinars, and surveys are often a crucial part of how a marketing organization reaches customers. Events and webinars contain many moving parts and can be complex to manage. Dynamics 365 for Marketing simplifies this process by bringing all the planning data into one central location and providing execution channels through a customizable event portal. Surveys are often provided post-event, but can also be used throughout the marketing lifecycle to solicit feedback. Through Microsoftâ€™s Voice of the Customer solution, surveys are easy to set up, manage, execute, and associate to an event.

  This course will cover event planning, including setting up and managing sessions, speakers, passes, waitlists, venues, sponsors, vendors, logistics, and accommodations; as well as event execution, such as creating custom registration fields, managing registrations and check ins, and the event portal; then the course will cover survey creation and distribution. Finally, it will conclude with event and survey results.

  Learn all the event and survey functionality within Dynamics 365 for Marketing through custom demonstrations, check your knowledge questions, and hands-on learning labs.
