summary: |-
  As
  demand for organizations to enable workforces to be more mobile, a Desktop
  Administrator’s role is really is no longer about just “desktop” management.
  With BYOD becoming commonplace and the need for employees to access line of
  business apps on personal devices, the scope of desktop administration must
  include both desktop and mobile devices, regardless of ownership. During this
  course, students will be introduced to key components of modern management and
  co-management strategies. They will examine what it takes to incorporate Microsoft
  Intune into an organization and how to use it to manage modern
  desktops and devices. Students will also learn about methods for deployment and
  management of apps and browser-based applications.

  #### Audience profile
  The Modern Desktop Administrator (MDA) deploys, configures, secures, manages, and monitors devices and client applications in an enterprise environment. Responsibilities include managing identity, access, policies, updates, and apps. The MDA collaborates with the M365 Enterprise Administrator to design and implement a device strategy that meets the business needs of a modern organization. The MDA must be familiar with M365 workloads and must have strong skills and experience of deploying, configuring, and maintaining Windows 10 and non-Windows devices. The MDA role focuses on cloud services rather than on-premises management technologies.
