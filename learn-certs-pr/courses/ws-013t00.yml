  ### Module 2&#58; Operating and maintaining Azure Stack HCI
  This module describes how to implement, manage, and maintain workloads on Azure Stack HCI. As described in the first module, Azure Stack HCI is designed to optimize performance, resiliency, and scalability of specific types of workloads. Implementing these workloads follows the initial configuration, which involves provisioning virtualized storage and networking layers on top of the hardware approved by Microsoft that is running the Windows Server 2019 operating system. This module provides an overview of different Azure services and Windows Server functionality that can be used to manage and maintain those workloads, leveraging integration of Windows Server 2019 with Azure.
