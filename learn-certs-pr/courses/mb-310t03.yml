  ### Module  3&#58; Configure and Use Budget Planning Processes
  With budget planning functionality one can consolidate multiple budget plans from a lower level into a single parent budget plan at a higher level in the organization. This is called bottom up approach budget planning which allows a budget planner to aggregate other plans into a high level or corporate plan for budgeting. One can also take the top down approach, which requires developing a single budget plan at a higher level of the organization and allocating the budget to lower levels of the organization. Use this method when historical financial transactions of the company are relied upon, and create a centralized plan which can be allocated throughout different operating units defined by an organization hierarchy with budget planning purpose. The budget planner, as a final step of the budget planning, generates the budget register entry based on the budget plan. An organization can configure budget planning, and then set up budget planning collaborative processes to meet its policies, procedures, and requirements for budget preparation. This module explains how to configure and test Budget planning processes.
