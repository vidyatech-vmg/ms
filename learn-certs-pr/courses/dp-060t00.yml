summary: |-
  This course will teach the students what is Cosmos DB and how you can migrate MongoDB and Cassandra workloads to Cosmos DB.

  #### Audience profile
  The primary audience for this course is database developers who plan to migrate their MongoDB or Cassandra DB workloads to Azure using Cosmos DB.
prerequisitesSection: |-
  Successful students start this role with a fundamental knowledge of cloud computing concepts and professional experience in configuring NoSQL applications.
  
  Specifically&#58;
  - The fundamental concepts of partitioning, replication, and resource governance for building and configuring scalable NoSQL applications that are agnostic of Cosmos DB API. 
  -	Experience with Azure, such as deploying and managing resources
  
  To gain these skills, take the following free online training before attending the course&#58;
