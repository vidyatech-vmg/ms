  ### Module  3&#58; Create fiscal calendars, years and periods
  Before posting transactions, a new fiscal year must be divided into periods. This is because transactions cannot post unless a period is created for the posting date and shared across multiple legal entities. A benefit of sharing fiscal calendars is that this supports multiple fiscal calendars for each legal entity. The fiscal year in Finance and Operations can be set to any length and divided into any number of periods. This module explains fiscal and ledger calendar management in Finance and Operations.

  A journal is a worksheet that one can use before manually enter postings into the system. When set up correctly, journals allow to quickly and efficiently manage posting. To use a journal, there must be a journal name, and the configuration of the ledger, journal, and posting of the General ledger module should be complete. By using the General ledger journal directly or via the General ledger processing workspace, one can perform daily activities as someone who is assigned proper security role to access the General ledger. A journal name gives financial leaders the capability to control data entry validation and restrict posting of a journal name for users differently.

  ### Module  9&#58; Perform Daily Procedures
  Every manual posting entered in Finance and Operations is entered through a journal. A journal is a type of worksheet where entries do not post immediately. One can review, change, and verify completed journals until they are ready for posting. A voucher template is a voucher that can be used as the basis for future vouchers in other journal entries. One can use voucher templates with a general journal or any of the financial sub ledger journals, such as Accounts payable and Accounts receivable journals.

  Lastly, they learned how to benefit from voucher templates for Amount, which is simply copying the exact amount of the template as new lines, or Percent, which converts the amounts in the voucher into percentage factors; this allows any amount to be applied when the voucher template is selected.

  ### Module  10&#58; Intercompany Accounting
  Intercompany accounting can help organizations by providing a single-entry point for transactions that must be recorded to multiple companies. Making transactions from a single company saves data entry time and helps provide a guarantee that transactions affecting multiple companies are recorded in each company. Finance and Operations also helps trace the intercompany entries through the system. It has the functionality that is required by most companies that process intercompany transactions. This includes the ability to efficiently record intercompany sales orders, purchase orders, and cash disbursements.
