  ### Module 5&#58; Implement and manage expense management
  You can use the Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations apps expense management to create an integrated workflow where you can store payment method information, import credit card transactions, and track the money that employees spend when they incur expenses for your business. You can also define expense policies and automate the reimbursement of travel expenses. Expense report entry has been redesigned to simplify the experience and decrease the time that is required to complete expense reports. You can turn on this functionality in Feature management. You can add a new setup page to configure the visibility of expense fields, and specify what data is required, optional, or not available when expense reports are entered. When this functionality is turned on, a new expense workspace is available. This workspace replaces the previous expense workspace and is the landing page for the improved entry experience. Travel and expense management has a strong value proposition for organizations with discretionary spending. Travel and entertainment expenses are a significant part of a company's controllable expense. To help curb these costs, expense management provides a mechanism to define and apply expense policies, in addition to flagging and reporting on abusers of the policies. Additionally, automating the entry and reimbursement of travel and entertainment expenses reduces processing costs versus manual entry. Expense management has tight integration with other modules such as Accounts payable, General ledger, Procurement, and sourcing and Project management and accounting.

  ### Module 6&#58; Implement and manage accounts receivable and credit and collections
  You need to configure the Accounts receivable module to be able to perform A/R functionality. You could then create customer invoices, post packing slips, use free text invoices that are not related to sales orders, and receive payments by using several different payment types such as cash, checks, credit cards, and electronic payments from your customers. Managing prospects and customers properly helps businesses to fulfil some of their requirements, such as customers’ satisfaction. At the same time, proper management avoids loss by checking many factors such as the credit limit and blocking the order being processed if it violates the policies of the company. Salespersons are the key for company’s revenue, and their commissions should be taken care of upon completion of the sales cycle.
