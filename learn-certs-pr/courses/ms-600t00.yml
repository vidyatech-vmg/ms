summary: |-
  This course covers five central elements of Microsoft 365 platform â€“ implementing Microsoft Identity, working with Microsoft Graph, extending and customizing SharePoint, extending Teams, and extending Office.
  In this course, students will learn how to implement Microsoft Identity and work with Microsoft Graph. Students will also gain the knowledge on UI elements (including Adaptive Cards and UI Fabric), Integration Points (including Microsoft Teams, Office Add-ins, SharePoint Framework, Actionable Messages), and determining workload platform targets.
  In implementing Microsoft Identity, students will learn to implement Microsoft identity including registering an application, implanting authentication, configuring permissions to consume an API, and creating a service to access Microsoft Graph.
  In working with Microsoft Graph, students will learn how to access user data, explore query parameters, manage a group lifecycle, access files, and optimize network traffic using Microsoft Graph.
  In extending and customizing SharePoint, students will learn about SharePoint Framework web parts, extensions, and how to package and deploy a SPFx solution.
  In extending Teams, students will look at the components of a Teams App, work with webhooks, tabs, and conversational bots.
  In extending Office, students work with Office Add-ins, task pane add-ins, JavaScript APIs, Office UI Fabric, and actionable messages with adaptive cards.
