  ### Module  2&#58; Perform Accounts Payable Daily Procedures
  Purchasing goods for resale, as materials for manufacturing or services is a large responsibility. Tracking those purchases and paying the vendors that supply the goods is just as challenging. Organizations must monitor accounts payable closely and implement procedures so management can easily obtain the financial information that they need to have to stay informed about changes in the costs of goods. To give an accurate view of the financial condition of the business, all expenses that affect net profit are included in accounts payable. This module explains how to manage and apply prepayments, record invoices, and process payments.
